	    	<p class="bio">On August 15, 1977, an earthquake destroyed the city of Ulan Bator. Two days later, an infant crawled out of the Gobi, an ancient scroll tied to his foot. In a dialect of Mandarin not seen or heard in over two thousand years, the scroll read, <em>Take this boy to East Caldwell. He is … the one.</em>  No one in Mongolia could understand the note, so the boy spent 18 years as a junior goat herder.  His life was simple and serene. Chance, and perhaps providence, brought a scholar of ancient Chinese into the boy’s life when a lightning bolt destroyed the scholar’s plane. Recuperating in the boy’s yurt, the scholar noticed the scroll and was happy to translate. The next day, the boy, who was now a man, boarded a plane to East Caldwell, the most mysterious town in New Jersey. He quickly impressed the residents with his genius and completed twelve grades of schooling in two months. His next stop was Cornell University. His genius so intimidated the physics professors, they begged him to change his course of study. Filled with pity, he did just that.  Physics gave way to film and the rest is history.  Needless to say, the boy who crawled out of the Gobi was none other than world-famous director <strong>Jason Maran</strong>.  His films have inspired the world. His vision has given hope to the hopeless. Joy to joyless. Hair to the hairless.  So ahead of his time, most of his films have yet to be made. But he will make them. That is his promise. His oath.  All will be one with his films. The final singularity. So let it be written. So let it be done.</p>
